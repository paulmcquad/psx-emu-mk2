APG_C - A Quake-style Console mini-library
Author:   Anton Gerdelan - @capnramses

Language: C99
Status:   Working. Not tested across compilers/platforms yet. Expect warnings.
Contact:  <antongdl@protonmail.com>
Website:  https://github.com/capnramses/apg - http://antongerdelan.net/
Licence:  See bottom of this file.
Version History:
  v0.3 - 2020/06/07 - Doubled length of tmp strings to avoid truncation warnings.
  v0.2 - 2020/01/04 - Moved to apg libraries repository. Minor tweaks from testing in a game integration.
  v0.1 - 2020/01/06 - Reduced interface. Moved from stored float cvars to addresses of existing vars. Data type is also specified for bool/int/uint/float support.

Instructions
============
* Just drop the 4 files into your project (console and pixel font source code).
* No external image or font assets are required. The font is hard-coded into the source code.
* This file is the console interface - #include "apg_console.h" in your application code.
* Your program handles keyboard capture and drawing.
* You then feed keyboard input to this console.
* You ask this console to render an RGBA image to memory.
* You then use that for drawing any way you like. You don't need a 3D graphics API.

The primary interface for user-entered text is:

  apg_c_append_user_entered_text( str );

Where `str` can be a whole line or eg one character at a time.
Instructions end and are entered and parsed after a line break `\n` byte.

Autocompletion of user-entered text is supported. e.g. After you application detects the TAB key is pressed call:

  apg_c_autocomplete();

Instructions may be of the following forms:

  BUILT-IN-COMMAND [VARIABLE] [VALUE]
  VARIABLE
  FUNCTION [VALUE]

Built-in commands include:

  "help"           - list built-in commands.
  "my_var 2.0"     - set the value of a variable 'my_var'.
  "my_var"         - print the value of variable 'my_var'.
  "clear"          - invoke the 'clear' command.
  "list_vars"      - print registered variables and their values to drop-down console
  "list_funcs"     - print registered variables and their values to drop-down console

Variables may also be registered, or accessed programmatically:

  apg_c_register_var( str, var_ptr, datatype )
  apg_c_get_var()

C functions can be called from console by registering a command name and function to call.
Your callback functions must be in the form `bool my_function( float arg )`. If your function returns false the console prints an error message.
User functions always require 1 float argument but if it is called from the drop-down console without supplying an argument then the argument value is set to 0.

  apg_c_register_func( str, function_ptr );

Scrolling output text may be interacted with programmatically:

  apg_c_output_clear()   - Clear the output text.
  apg_c_print( str )     - Adds a line of text to the output such as a debug message.
  apg_c_dump_to_stdout() - Writes the current console output text to stdout via printf().
  apg_c_count_lines()    - Counts the number of lines in the console output.

The console text may also be rendered out to an image for use in any graphical applications.
This is API-agnostic so must be converted to a texture to be used with 3D APIs.

  apg_c_draw_to_image_mem()       - Writes current console text on top of a pre-allocated image.
  apg_c_image_redraw_required()   - Check if anything has actually changed requiring a redraw. You should also redraw if eg the display area changes size.
